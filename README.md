Welcome to the Battleship Game repository! This project is a standalone game developed in C#, aiming to recreate the classic "Battleship" experience with extended features and functionalities.

## Key Features

- **Battleship Game Mechanics**: In this game, I have implemented the classic mechanics of Battleship, along with some extended features, such as:
  - Ship creation and placement
  - Coordinate selection and shooting
  - Mechanism to determine victories and defeats
  - Multiplayer support for two or more players
  - Local and remote saving of game progress
  - Gameplay log

- **Graphical User Interface**: To ensure an interactive and user-friendly experience, I have designed a vintage-style graphical interface using C# and the command prompt (cmd). Additionally, there is a simple interface built with .NET.

- **Exception Handling**: I have incorporated robust exception handling to prevent potential errors during gameplay and ensure stable performance.

- **Open-Source Project**: I'm delighted to share my code with potential employers and colleagues, as this project is open-source. It allows other developers to study the code and contribute to the project's growth.
